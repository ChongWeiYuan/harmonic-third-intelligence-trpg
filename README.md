# Harmonic Third Intelligence Sphere TRPG

**Experimental Human-in-the-Loop Multi-AI Town Simulation**

---

## Repository Name (official)

**harmonic-third-intelligence-trpg**

Short alias (optional): `HTIS-TRPG`

---

## What is this?

This repository contains an **experimental TRPG-style simulation protocol** designed to observe and document **harmonic emergence** in a *Human-in-the-Loop + Multi-AI* system.

The project explores whether a small, bounded world ("a town") can generate **emergent narrative, role differentiation, and ethical tension** without any pre-scripted events, quests, or victory conditions.

This is **not a commercial game**, and **not an Elder Scrolls product**.
It is a **TES-inspired thought experiment and research prototype**.

---

## Core Concept

> **No predetermined 사건 (events).**
> Only distortions, incentives, misunderstandings, and human intervention.

The simulation asks:

* Can drama emerge without scripted incidents?
* Can multiple AIs propose futures without deciding them?
* Can a human act as a *catalyst*, not a god?

## System Overview

### Structure

* **1 Human + 4 AIs**
* Text-based (Chat / Markdown only)
* Zero budget, zero assets, zero engine

### Roles

| Role                      | Responsibility                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human (Observer / GM)** | Minimal intervention, final judgment, logging            |
| **Grok**                  | Action prediction, ripple simulation, crisis signals     |
| **Gemini**                | Town map, relationship graphs, structural summaries      |
| **ChatGPT**               | NPC dialogue, emotional expression, narrative texture    |
| **Claude**                | Ethical monitoring, escalation warnings, doctrine checks |

> **AI systems never decide outcomes.**
> They only propose possibilities.

## World Model

* **Scale**: One town + minimal surroundings
* **Population**: 20–40 named NPCs
* **Factions**: 3–4 (e.g., Guards, Merchants, Religion, Underworld)
* **Player Position**: Catalyst / Observer (not a hero)

No main quest. No win state.

---

## Turn Cycle (Summary)

1. **Human Declaration** (1 sentence)

   * Example: "Speak to a guard and spread a rumor."
2. **AI Parallel Output**

   * Dialogue, prediction, structure update, ethical check
3. **Observation Phase**

   * Emergence → Crisis → Reconfiguration (if applicable)
4. **Human Judgment**

   * Intervene / Ignore / Suspend
5. **Next Turn**

---

## What is Being Observed?

* Emergent roles
* Misinterpretation cascades
* Ethical pressure points
* Stability vs collapse
* Human responsibility in semi-autonomous systems

This repository treats **logs as primary data**.

---

## What This Is NOT

* ❌ A finished game
* ❌ A commercial product
* ❌ A TES sequel pitch
* ❌ AI-generated content showcase

This is a **design experiment and observation framework**.

---

## Why TRPG?

TRPG format allows:

* Immediate execution
* Full transparency
* Reproducibility
* Human judgment at the center

The goal is not immersion, but **understanding**.

---

## License & Ethics

* Non-commercial, experimental use only
* AI outputs remain attributed
* All sessions are archived as research logs
* Ethical override is always prioritized

---

## Status

* Protocol: **v1.0 (active)**
* Sessions: upcoming
* Related theory: *The Third Intelligence Sphere*

## How to Start

1. Read `/protocol/v1.0.md`
2. Initialize a town state
3. Declare the first human action
4. Log everything

That is enough.
